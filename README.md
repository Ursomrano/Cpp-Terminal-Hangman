# Cpp-Terminal-Hangman
It's hangman that runs in a linux terminal, big shocker

This program uses jp2a linux terminal commands, so if your linux terminal doesn't have that installed, install it. 
In Ubuntu based distro's type "sudo apt install jp2a" into your terminal to install it. IDK about other distor's however.

Also make sure to go in the Hangman.cpp file in the Graphic() function and change the directory string to the directory you have the cpp file and the photo's in.
