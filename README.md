# Cpp-Terminal-Hangman
It's hangman that runs in a linux terminal, big shocker

This program uses jp2a linux terminal commands, so if your linux terminal doesn't have that installed, install it. 
In Ubuntu based distro's type "sudo apt install jp2a" into your terminal to install it. IDK about other distor's however.
